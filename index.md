## About Me

I am a fourth-year Ph.D. student in the Computer Science Department at [The University of Hong Kong](https://hku.hk/), supervised by Prof. [Jia Pan](https://sites.google.com/site/panjia/) and Prof. [Wenping Wang](https://www.cs.hku.hk/people/academic-staff/wenping). Before that, I received both the B.Eng. degree and the M.Eng. degree from [Sun Yat-sen University](https://www.sysu.edu.cn/), advised by Prof. [Guanbin Li](http://guanbinli.com/). Currently, my research interests include Robotics, Vision-and-Language, with particular interests in task planning, vision-and-language navigation and manipulation, and applications of LLMs.
